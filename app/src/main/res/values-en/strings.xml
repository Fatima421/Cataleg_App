    <string name="aboutUs">About Us</string>
    <string name="aboutUsText"> We are a group named Cat Renat, a team of 2 people.
        <b>Erik Michel and Fatima Sahar Syed.</b>
        We have made this app with great enthusiasm and desire, we have dedicated hours and hours during these months.
        It has been a long process in which we have had fun and learned a lot, there have been more tense moments
        where things didn\'t come out as we wished or simply we just didn\'t have enough time, but in the end, we managed to make an app with all the values that we want to convey.</string>
    <string name="aboutApp">About the app</string>
    <string name="aboutAppText">
        Our app has been created to spread content in Catalan and at the same time promote and encourage the use of the Catalan language.
        \n\nIt is aimed at the general audience, there is no age restriction, anyone can inform themselves through the sections created.
        For this reason, there is also a variety of sections, we have a section dedicated to Catalan music, another to Catalan series, films, and documentaries, another about the available games translated to Catalan, and finally Catalan books.\n\n
        Through this app, you can find out on which platform is all this content or where to buy it.
        It provides links to all sites, and it\'s made with an intuitive and user-friendly design.</string>
